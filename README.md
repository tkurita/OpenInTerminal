Open in Terminal
================
"Open in Terminal" make a new terminal window of the working directory depending on the frontmost context. The frontmost context means,

- If Finder is in frontmost, the working directory is Finder's selected location.
- If a document window opened by certain application stays in frontmost, the folder containing the file will be the working directory of new terminal window.

When there is a terminal of the target working directory, the terminal window will be bring to front instead of opening new terminal. This feature helps to avoid terminal windows scattering.
